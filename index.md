### Baltimore County Department of Age Data Analysis
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In an effort of understanding the needs of seniors who are struggling the most, Baltimore County combined AWA surveys with members' demographic information to identify potential demographic factors that could influence health disparities in the county' s population. I assisted with data cleaning, analysis, and creating dashboard reports for stakeholders. The reports informed decision-making on resource allocation to improve the well-being of seniors in a specific center.

### Allegion Customer Review Sentiment Analysis / NLP
<div style="text-align: justify;">
As a team of three, we completed a Customer Review Sentiment Analysis final project for Allegion PLC, a provider of security products for home and business. Using sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and topic modeling techniques, we cleaned and analyzed a dataset of 30,000 customer reviews. Our findings revealed that positive reviews were largely related to installation, appearance, and ease of use, while negative reviews were associated with issues such as product durability, keypad functionality, and customer service. We also observed a decline in positive reviews at the beginning of 2020 and the negative reviews around that time were specifically related to Allegion's mobile application.

### Home Credit Default Risk / Machine Learning
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Home Credit launched a Kaggle competition to develop a successful predictive model based on diverse data points such as credit and cash transactions, demographics, and past applications to help the unbanked to achieve their financial goals safely and positively. In the team project, we explored datasets, used automatic feature engineering tools like featuretools to create new features, and applied the advanced neural network, Pytorch Lightning to build a predictive model with the best AUC of 0.74.

### Recipe App Development using MongoDB for database system / NoSQL
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Our team developed a functional web application using MongoDB as a NoSQL database system for data storage and retrieval. We leveraged our knowledge of SQL queries to create basic CRUD functionality - Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete. Our application allowed users to retrieve recipes based on their preferences for cooking time, diets, main ingredients, grocery stores, and cuisines. We extracted about 40,000 recipes from the Edamam API and stored approximately 20,000 grocery items in the MongoDB database.

In addition to recipe retrieval, users could create an account, rate recipes, and save their favorite recipes. Our application offered a user-friendly experience and helped users find the perfect recipe and the estimated grocery costs for their needs.
