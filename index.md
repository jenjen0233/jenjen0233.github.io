### Baltimore County Department of Age Project
<br>
In an effort of understanding the needs of seniors who are struggling the most, Baltimore County combined AWA surveys with members' demographic information to identify potential demographic factors that could influence health disparities in the county' s population. I assisted with data cleaning, analysis, and creating dashboard reports for stakeholders. The reports informed decision-making on resource allocation to improve the well-being of seniors in a specific center.

### Home Credit Default Risk / Machine Learning
<br>
Home Credit launched a Kaggle competition to develop a successful predictive model based on diverse data points such as credit and cash transactions, demographics, and past applications to help the unbanked to achieve their financial goals safely and positively. In this project, we explored datasets, used automatic feature engineering tools like featuretools to create new features, and applied the advanced neural network, Pytorch Lightning to build a predictive model with the best AUC of 0.74.
